- Rework MainForm's implementation of ILogSink so that it doesn't have to redraw anything every time Log is called.
	Right now, updating the log text dramatically slows down free-running execution of the VM.

- Add ability to interrupt execution with button press. Right now, VM execution is done on the UI thread,
	so the user has no way to stop it.


 - Implement save/restore of sessions, with a default session that has certain IO devices set up.
	This will speed up my testing and save end users time doing basic device setup.
